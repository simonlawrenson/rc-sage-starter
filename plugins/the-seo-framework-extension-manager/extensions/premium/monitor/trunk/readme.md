This extension keeps track of your website's SEO, optimization, uptime, and statistics.

## Overview

### Let us look

Maintaining a WordPress website isn't easy.
Before you start, you must find a suitable theme, good plugins, and then set them all up.

You might not be wary of your website's issues, its performance, and sometimes plugins conflict with the theme or eachother.

This is where our Monitor services come in handy.
Monitor looks at your website as a real visitor would. Directly from our servers.
Without WordPress' obstruction, it checks if all the basics have correctly been set up.

### An inspection for WordPress

Like other web inspectors, Monitor looks for basic website errors.
Unlike other web inspectors, it compares found data to your WordPress environment, through a two-phase check.

The first phase happens on our servers, where we crawl several URLs on your website to find common issues. All information we find is sent back to the Monitor extension.

The second phase happens in your dashboard, where the information is compared to your WordPress environement, like SEO settings.

This cooperation creates personalized information, like no other inspector could.

### Statistical data, bundled with your license

*N.B. These features are under construction. ETA early 2018.*

Website statistics, like uptime and performance, can cost you unnecessarily amounts.

With Monitor, it's included in your Premium license.

#### A fast website

Website performance is a ranking factor. Not directly, but eventually so.

This is because us humans like responsive interaction. If a website is too slow, then we'll bounce back to the search results.
Thus increasing your website's bounce rate.

Increased bounce rate indicates to search engines that your content wasn't relevant to the search query.
When this happens more often than not, your website will fall in search ranking position.

Monitor will, in set intervals, check your website's performance.

#### High uptime

Website uptime is another ranking factor. This one is directly measured.

Naturally, a website that cannot be reached won't sell anything and will miss out on user engagement.
A website that's down will also increase bounce rate. As described earlier, your website will then fall in search ranking position.

When a website is down often, a page can be seen as missing. This can eventually deindex your pages from the search results.

Monitor will, also in set intervals, check your website's uptime. So you can be certain that your website is available.

### Privacy first

Monitor is a web service running on our servers.
To operate, our servers only require your website's URL and a key.

The key is generated when you first connect the Extension Manager to our API services.
This helps us validate your website's integrity, so we know it's your website contacting us.

When crawling, Monitor looks at your website as any other visitor would, or could.
And, when you disconnect your site from our services, all crawled data will be erased.

## Usage

[tsfep-bundled]

### Activate Monitor

First, you'll need to activate Monitor.

After activating the extension, you'll find a menu link displayed next to the activation button.
That link will direct you to the Monitor registration page.

### Registration

On the registration page, you'll find a privacy statement. Beneath it, you can connect your website.

When you hit the "Register" button, your site will be registered.

Your website will also automatically be enqueued for a crawl.

### Crawling

Crawling a website from our servers can take from a few seconds up to three minutes.

This is done in scheduled one-minute intervals. When many sites are in the queue, some might be moved upfront at the next interval.

If you wish to enqueue a crawl, click on the "Request Crawl" button in the Control Panel.

### Updating

To receive the latest Monitor data, hit "Update Data".

If you just initiated a crawl request, you might receive outdated or incorrect data. It takes time to crawl a website, after all.
