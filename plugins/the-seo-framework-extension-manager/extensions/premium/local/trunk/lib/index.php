 * Who is this self, behind the self, the watching self? Can you watch that one?
 * It's interesting if you do, because you find out, of course, that this is just
 * as the problem of grace is nothing more than a transposition of the first problem...
 * "How am I to be unselfish by my own power?"

 * It becomes "How am I to get grace by my own power...?"
 * So, in the same way we find that the watching self or the observing self
 * behind all our thoughts and feelings is itself a thought.
