This extension guides you through the process of writing targeted content that ranks with focus keywords, their inflections, and their synonyms.

## Overview

### Focus your content

With over 1 billion competing websites, your pages barely stand a chance ranking on the first page of Google.
So, writing quality content that ranks well in search engines isn't easy. This is where Focus comes in.

This extension helps you to focus your content to a few well targeted search phrases, greatly increasing your chances to rank on the first page.

### Your personal guide

After defining the subject of the page you're writing, Focus rates your page on various SEO principles. These principles include subject density, linking, and more.
They help you to see how well you've increased your chances to be ranked higher.

### More topics, more keywords

When your page covers more topics, you should utilize more keywords.
With Focus, you can use three keywords that make up three subjects.

Each keyword makes up for a new subject. Focus rates each subject separately.

### It comes with a dictionary

There are many ways to write in a language. And with a Premium subscription you can embrace all Focus has to offer.

So, after you fill in a keyword, Focus will connect to our API services and will provide you with related synonyms and inflections.
With those, Focus is able to rate your content more accurately.

The synonyms provided make up for great writing suggestions. Utilizing those synonyms will increase your chances to be found, too.

### Using Focus

On every page with SEO capabilities, you'll find the Audit menu.

Under the audit menu, you can configure Focus for each page.

#### Start getting rated

After you fill in a keyword, Focus starts rating your content.

#### Select lexical form

***(Premium only)***

If your keyword matches an entry in our dictionary, you can select a lexical form.

You should select the form that describes your subject most, this is sorted from common to uncommon usage.
So, choosing the first form is often correct.

#### Select homonymous example

***(Premium only)***

Some words have more than one meaning. So, after selecting the lexical form, example sentences are formed.
These sentences are also sorted in order of the most common form, and the most common sentence is automatically selected.

Change the example sentence that closely describes your subject, and you could get different synonyms.

#### Select active inflections and synonyms

***(Premium only)***

After all synonyms and inflections have been received, simply click on the ones you'd like to use.

If you haven't used a synonym in your content yet, consider using it as it'll increase your chances on being found.

### Ratings

The ratings tell you what should be improved in your content.

Use these ratings as guidelines for focused content.
You shouldn't ruin your content just to get a better rating.

#### Meta vs Page Title

The page title is what's displayed to the user on your website.
You can change this at the top of your content editor.

The meta title is what's displayed to a potential visitor on Google.
You can change this under the General tab of the page's SEO settings.

#### First Paragraph

The first paragraph is the first block of text found in your content editor.
In writing, the first paragraph is used to annotate what your content is about.

It's the best place to use your focus keyword.

#### Subject Density

Annotating keywords, inflections, and synonyms more throughout your content is a signal for search engines what your content is about.

When your subject density is too high, your page might seem like spam.

#### Linking

Linking to other pages related to a subject is a great signal to search engines which helps them distinguish homonyms.
So, consider adding one or two links related to the subject.

Focus will detect a link when a word is found in the URL, content, or title of an `<a>` tag.

#### Meta description

Meta descriptions don't help in ranking. However, they do help potential visitors to know if the content they're looking for is on your page.

If the subject isn't found in the meta description, Google often tries to fill it in with a (often confusing) sentence from your content.
So, to prevent this from happening, Focus notifies you via this rating.

#### Page URL

One of the best ways to be found on a keyword is by placing it in the page URL. So, be sure to include it here.

You can change your page URL right above the content editor.
