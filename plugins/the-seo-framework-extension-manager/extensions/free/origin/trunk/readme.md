This extension redirects attachment-page visitors back to the parent post.

## Overview

### Clean up the web

Within WordPress, you can easily upload and manage your media.
This media, like an image, is often placed inside post content.

WordPress creates a new page as a placeholder for each attachment. This it not beneficial for most websites, because your visitors on those pages won't see the originally intended context.

With Origin, visitors of the attachment pages are sent to the respective post or page.
